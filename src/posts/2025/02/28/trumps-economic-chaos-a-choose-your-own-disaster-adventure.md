Alright, folks, strap in because the Trump economy is now an interactive thriller where nobody knows what happens next!

First up: Tariffs! Trump said he’d slap a 25% tax on Canada and Mexico, then hit pause, then un-paused. Are they actually happening next week? Nobody knows!

Next: Trade War, Europe Edition! Trump claims the EU was "formed to screw the U.S." (Fun fact: we actually helped create it for peace and democracy). Will he start a trade war with them? Nobody knows!

And now, our favorite cliffhanger: Government Shutdown! Federal funding runs out on March 14, and Republicans might not have the votes to keep the lights on. Will the government grind to a halt? Betting markets say probably!

Oh, but wait! Trump’s also threatening to fire half the Social Security Administration. Will essential services collapse? You guessed it—nobody knows!

And now, the season finale: Trump’s Plan to Destroy the Global Economy! Rumor has it the administration wants to swap short-term U.S. debt for 100-year bonds, aka a Mar-a-Lago Special. This would basically be a U.S. debt default, shaking the entire world economy. But is Trump actually serious? Nobody kn— oh, you get it.

Why all this chaos? Simple: America is currently run by an ignorant, vengeful megalomaniac with zero impulse control. And, no, it’s not just Elon Musk.

Take Trump’s latest brainwave: investing in Russia! You know, the place where critics tend to accidentally fall out of windows. Meanwhile, the EU (which Trump is alienating) has nine times Russia’s GDP. But sure, great investment strategy.

And let’s not even start on the AI-generated Gaza video Trump just shared on Truth Social.

Now, why does all this matter? Because businesses need stability to invest in factories, jobs, and long-term growth. But with Trump at the wheel, CEOs are playing economic roulette, waiting for some kind of policy coherence before making major investments.

Bottom line? I’m not saying a recession is coming—because predicting Trump’s economy is like predicting a toddler’s tantrum—but business leaders are definitely sweating. Consumer sentiment is tanking, economists are worried, and corporate optimism just hit its lowest point since 2022.

But don’t expect next week’s job numbers to tell us much—those are from early February, when the Trump train had just left the station. The real impact of this economic whiplash? Give it a few months.

One thing’s for sure: having an impulsive man-child in charge is not great for business. And if you thought otherwise, well…you might need to rethink your investment strategy.
